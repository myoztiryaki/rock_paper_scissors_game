### Game

# You decide to create a Rock-Paper-Scissor game. 

# ðŸ“Œ Create a Rock-Paper-Scissor game in which the user plays against the computer. The player will choose one of the actions, and the computer will choose its action randomly.

#Import the random library
import random
#create a list containing the three actions of the game.
action_list = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
#Set the scores of players to 0
computer_score = 0
player_score = 0

#Ask the user how many rounds they want to play
total_round = input("How many rounds do you wnat yo play? Please enter a number here: ")

#Add a round_counter that is 0 at the beginning
round_counter = 0

#Write a while loop and put the game inside
while True:

  #Increase round_counter by and print it
  round_counter += 1
  print("Round number:", round_counter)


  #Select a random action for computer
  computer_choice = random.choice(action_list)

  #Ask player to choose an action
  player_choice = input("Please choose your action:")

  #Print the players choices
  print("Computer", computer_choice)
  print("Player", player_choice)


  #tie condition

  #Remaining conditions
